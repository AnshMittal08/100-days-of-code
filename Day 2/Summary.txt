Day 2 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge:

=> Solved 2 coding problems on CodeChef, focusing on arrays, vectors, loops, and basic if-else statements.
   1. AIRLINE - https://www.codechef.com/problems/AIRLINE
   2. CHEFARRP - https://www.codechef.com/problems/CHEFARRP
   
=> Explored the problem solving strategy through College Walah's YouTube tutorials.

   Target Sum Problem - https://youtu.be/DhlDG8f1bZI

=> I also dedicated time to learning about target sum problems involving arrays and vectors.  
   I explored various strategies to approach these problems and attempted to implement them on my own.

=> Excited to continue learning and improving coding skills over the next 98 days! ğŸ’»ğŸš€ #100DaysOfCode #CodingJourney
